# Discord Notification Setup

To enable Discord notifications, you will need a **Discord Webhook URL**.  
This URL allows the system to send messages directly to a specific Discord channel.

You can create a webhook by following this [official Discord guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/228383668).  
Once created, simply paste the webhook URL into the designated field in your notification settings.
