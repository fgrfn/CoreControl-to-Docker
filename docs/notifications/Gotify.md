# Gotify Notification Setup

To enable Gotify notifications, you need the following information from your Gotify server:

- **Gotify URL**  
  The base URL of your Gotify server (e.g., `https://gotify.example.com`).  

- **Gotify Token**  
  The application token used to authenticate and send messages.  

## How to get these values:

1. **Log in to your Gotify server.**
2. **Go to the "Applications" section.**
3. **Create a new application** (e.g., "System Alerts").
4. **Copy the generated token** â€” this is your Gotify Token.
5. **Use your server's URL** as the Gotify URL.
