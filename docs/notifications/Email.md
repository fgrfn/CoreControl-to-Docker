# Email Notification Setup

To enable email or SMTP notifications, the following fields must be configured:

- **SMTP HOST**  
  The address of the SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com` or `mail.example.com`).  
  *→ Specifies which server will be used to send emails.*

- **SMTP PORT**  
  The port used for sending (typically `465` for SSL or `587` for TLS).  
  *→ Defines the communication channel to the SMTP server.*

- **Secure Connection**  
  Indicates whether a secure connection is used (`SSL` or `TLS`).  
  *→ Important for secure transmission of emails.*

- **SMTP Username**  
  The username for the email account (often the full email address).  
  *→ Used to authenticate with the SMTP server.*

- **SMTP Password**  
  The corresponding password or an app-specific password.  
  *→ Also required for authentication. Make sure to store it securely.*

- **From Address**  
  The sender's email address (e.g., `noreply@example.com`).  
  *→ This address will appear as the sender in the recipient's inbox.*

- **To Address**  
  The recipient's email address where notifications should be sent.  
  *→ Can be your personal email or a designated support inbox.*
